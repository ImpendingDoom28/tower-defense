When writting js/ts code, use the following rules:

- Always write typescript code until specified otherwise
- Prefer arrow functions over function declarations if possible (including react components)
- Use named exports instead of default exports
- Don't leave file extensions then importing to another file
- Separate imports in different groups by using new line (first group is library imports, second group is relative imports)
- Don't leave single-line comments if their meaning is useless, for example:
  ```ts
    // Tower Configuration` --> this is not okay
    export interface TowerConfig { ... }
  ```
- When writing types, prefer using type declaration instead of interfaces
- When defining event handlers custom function (for on click event, for example), use the naming convention starting with `on` example:

  ```tsx
  const onSelectTower = () => {
    /** implementation details */
  };

  <TowerShop
    //...
    onSelectTower={onSelectTower} // <-- name in this convention
  />;
  ```

- Always create a separate type for components props
- Remove unused imports if after your changes there are any

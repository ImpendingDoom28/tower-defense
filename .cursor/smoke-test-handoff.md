# Smoke Test Handoff

## Local App
- URL: http://localhost:5173/
- Requires dev server running: `npm run dev`

## Known UI Flow
1. Loading screen -> Main menu
2. Click **Play** -> In-game HUD
3. Tower Shop (left): Basic Tower, Slow Tower, AOE Tower, Laser Tower
4. Top-right: Money, Health, Wave status, **Start next wave** button
5. Click **Level Creator** from the main menu -> `/editor`
6. Editor HUD: left tool/action card, right inspector with Level, Paths, Buildings, Waves, Validation, Selection

## Smoke-Test Actions (Validated Sequence)
1. Click **Play**
2. Select **Basic Tower** (first tower in shop)
3. Place a tower on the board (click valid tile off the path)
4. Click **Start next wave**
5. Observe enemies spawning and moving along the path
6. Observe money and health changes in the HUD

## Verified Findings (Latest Run)
- Game loads and enters gameplay
- Tower placement works
- Shared tile occupancy refactor still allows valid off-path placement
- Re-clicking an occupied tile keeps selection active and does not spend money
- Clicking a path tile keeps selection active and does not spend money
- Waves start and enemies spawn
- Money changes consistent with kills (increases when enemies die)
- Health drops when enemies reach the end
- Wave progression advances to the next wave after wave completion
- Main menu now exposes **Level Creator**
- `/editor` route loads
- Editor HUD renders tool buttons plus Level/Paths/Waves inspector sections
- Level name input updates draft state
- Right-side inspector actions work for adding waves and paths

## Playwright Coverage
- Command: `npm run test:e2e`
- Base URL: `http://localhost:5173/`
- Config reuses an existing dev server when available and otherwise starts one through Playwright `webServer`
- Covered flows: main menu render, Play -> gameplay HUD, Basic Tower placement via fixed canvas coordinates, first wave start, `/editor` route load with inspector accordions
- Coordinate fixtures live in `tests/e2e/fixtures/canvasPoints.ts` and assume a `1280x720` viewport

## Still Unverified
- Upgrade-specific parity (wave 4+ empower flow)
- Slow/debuff timing parity
- Pause/resume parity (P key)
- Left editor action buttons (`Load Sample`, `Validate`, `Download JSON`) could not be fully exercised through browser automation due click interception on the floating left panel
- Scene-side editor tool interactions beyond right-panel state changes remain only partially verified
